The Iris dataset is considered a classic benchmark and has always served as a 
fundamental starting point for beginners and a reliable testing ground for advanced 
algorithms. Our main aim is to use machine learning techniques to categorize iris 
flowers based on their unique features.
• Machine learning offers a powerful and flexible approach to solving complex 
classification tasks. Traditional rule-based systems can struggle with capturing subtle 
patterns and relationships present in large datasets, whereas machine learning 
algorithms excel in automatically learning these patterns from data. 
• By employing machine learning techniques, the aim is to leverage the inherent 
adaptability of algorithms to discern intricate relationships within the Iris dataset and 
generalize these learnings to classify unseen instances accurately.
