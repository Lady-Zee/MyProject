    "Observations about the model performance \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Precision:\n",
    "   - The model shows varying precision across different classes, ranging from 0.59 to 1.00. It indicates that the model's ability to correctly classify instances differs by class.\n",
    "   - Some classes have relatively low precision (e.g., Ariel Sharon), meaning there are more false positives in those predictions.\n",
    "   - Other classes, like Hugo Chavez, have very high precision, suggesting that when the model predicts this class, it is often correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recall:\n",
    "   - The recall also differs across classes, ranging from 0.63 to 1.00. This shows that the model's ability to identify all instances of a particular class differs.\n",
    "   - The class Hugo Chavez has relatively low recall, which means that the model misses some actual instances of this class.\n",
    "   - Classes like Junichiro Koizumi have a perfect recall of 1.00, indicating that the model correctly identifies all instances of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. F1-Score:\n",
    "   - The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It reflects the balance between the two metrics.\n",
    "   - Classes with high F1-scores, such as George W Bush, have a strong balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "   - Classes with lower F1-scores may have an imbalance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Accuracy:\n",
    "   - The overall accuracy of the model is 0.81, indicating that the model correctly classifies approximately 81% of the instances in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Macro and Weighted Averages:\n",
    "   - The macro-average F1-score is 0.79, indicating the average performance across all classes without considering class imbalance.\n",
    "   - The weighted average F1-score is 0.82, which considers class imbalance and gives more weight to classes with more instances.\n",
    "\n",
