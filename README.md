Analysis and Interpretation:
Analysis of the box plots and violin plots comparing the distributions of the 'total_bill' variable across various categories of categorical variables - 'sex', 'smoker', 'day', 'time':

Box Plots: Sex: The box plot shows that the distribution of total bills seems to be somewhat higher for males than females. Although, the difference is not that significant. Smoker: Non-smokers seems to have somewhat lower total bills compared to smokers. But it indicate a wider spread in total bills for smokers. Day: The distribution of total bills shows that it varies across different days of the week. Saturday shows a higher median total bill compared to other days, with more outliers. Time: There is a difference in total bill distributions between lunch and dinner times. It can be inferred that dinner have higher median total bills compared to lunch.

Violin Plots: Sex: The violin plot shows some similiarities in the insights as the box plot in the distribution of total bills for males and females. The density of the data distribution indictes that males have slightly more variability in total bills more than females. Smoker: Violin plots show a clearer view of the distribution and density of total bills for both smokers and non-smokers. whereas the wider area in the violin plot for smokers shows higher variability in total bills among smokers. Day: Violin plots show the distribution of total bills across the days of the week, where Saturday exhibits a wider spread, illustrating a higher variability in total bills on Saturdays compared to the rest of the week. Time: Like the box plot, violin plots indicate the distribution of total bills for both lunch and dinner times. Dinner has a wider spread and higher density as indicated by higher total bills compared to lunch.

Outliers and Unusual Observations: Outliers can be seen in the box plots as points outside the whiskers. Saturday shows several outliers, showing unusually high total bills on Saturday. The wider spread of data in violin plots also indicates areas of higher variability, which may mean outliers or unusual observations.

In summary, the analysis of box plots and violin plots gave insights into the distribution and variability of total bills across various categories of categorical variables. The visualizations provide a better understanding into the patterns and trends in the data and helps to identify outliers or unusual observations that may require further investigation.

Interpretation and Reporting Looking at the univariate and bivariate analyses, a lot of key insights and observations can be highlighted:

Univariate Analysis: Numerical Variables (total_bill, tip, size): The summary statistics show that the mean total bill is  19.79,𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑓
 17.81. Tips have a mean of  2.99,𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑓
 2.90. The average size of the party is about 2.57. Looking at the Histograms of numerical variables, we can see that the distribution of total bills and tips is right-skewed, thus indicating that majority of the bills and tips are concentrated towards the lower end, with a few higher values. Likewise, there is an equal distribution of party sizes, with a slight skew towards smaller parties.

Categorical Variables (sex, smoker, day, time): Frequencies and proportions for categorical variables indicate that the dataset consists of roughly equal proportions of male and female customers, with a majority being non-smokers. Saturday is the busiest day, then Sunday, Thursday, and lastly Friday. Most customers patronize restaurants for dinner rather than they do for lunch.

Bivariate Analysis: Relationships Between Numerical Variables: There is a positive correlation in the scatter plots between total bill and tip. This is not unusual as larger bills tend to result in higher tips. There seems to be no actual relationship between total bill and party size.

Comparison Across Categorical Variables: In comparison of Box plots and violin plots distribution of total bills across the diverse categories of categorical variables, it shows interesting patterns, which is analyzed as follows: Males appear to have a somewhat higher total bills than females, although the difference is not too much. Smokers seems to have higher variability in total bills than non-smokers, which also shows some outliers meaning there is unusually high bills. Saturdays record the highest median total bills than any other days, with a wider spread showing higher variability. Dinner times have higher median total bills than lunch, with a wider spread showing higher variability in total bills.

In conclusion, the overall insights show there is a positive relationship between total bill and tip, meaning that customers seem to tip more for larger bills. The dataset shows variability in total bills across various categories of categorical variables, indicating that factors like gender, smoking habits, day of the week, and time of day can influence the amount spent at restaurants. Outliers in the data, specifically in total bill distributions, may mean special occasions or even exceptional spending behavior and thus warrant further investigation. These insights from the above analyses provide valuable information for restaurant owners and managers to understand how customers behave and also help them in making informed decisions about pricing, staffing, and service management. Further analysis and data-driven strategies can be used to help optimize restaurant operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
